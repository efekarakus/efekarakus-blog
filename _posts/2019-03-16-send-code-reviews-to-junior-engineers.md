title: Send code reviews to junior engineers
tags: [code reviews]
---
For a long time I didn't get the benefits of sending [code reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) (CRs) to engineers who are less experienced than me. A more senior developer knows the system better, other design patterns, language best-practices, but what does a junior engineer bring to me? I know it sounds selfish, but I couldn't think of an answer for a long time.

Well it really dawned on me while reading [A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhoust](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201). As software developers "our primary goal is to produce great design, which also happens to work". The code needs needs to be easy to understand and facilitate future extensions.

So who better to judge if your code is understandable than someone less experienced with the code base, problem, patterns? Every clarification question becomes a signal to refactor and improve the code base.
Making you a better engineer in return.
