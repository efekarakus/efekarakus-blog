[“Chapter 2.” The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts in Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact, by Edmond Lau](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Engineer-Engineering-Disproportionate-Meaningful/dp/0996128107/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550643410&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=the+effective+engineerin)

I recently switched teams within Amazon. While searching for a good fit, I created and used a template to interview managers and engineers. I tried to compress important values that I learned over the past 3.5 years into the document. Although all the questions weren't applicable to everyone, it provided a good starting point for a discussion. It took me over 2 months to find what I'm hoping is a good fit. If you also have the luxury of time, I'd recommend taking it slow to relieve pressure. The exercise of searching for a new team also re-iterated the importance of networking. I'm sharing my template here, hoping that it would be helpful for others. 

## Why switch teams?
There are several reasons why you might want to consider moving to a different team. The underlying theme is about maximizing your learning. This is not an exhaustive list, it's strictly from observations from friends and myself:
- **Toxic team environment**: You've team member(s) that're clearly jerks and are harming others. Management isn't willing to create a safe work environment. If you can't get along with the people, you won't have a good time at work.
- **Slow innovation pace**: Indecisive leadership that can't decide on the vision of a product will result in its failure. Analysis paralysis is deadly and reversible decisions shoud be embraced by management _*_.
- **Mastery**: Realign yourself with your personal interests within computing. Over time, I realized that I enjoy the most learning about software development practices and building/operating systems. 
- **Autonomy**: You should also be able to choose what to work on and have discussions with management to shape the product. Otherwise, you'll miss out on exciting projects.
- **People**: Surround yourself with people that will elevate you. Try to be closer to your role models. The new team that I joined works with a principal engineer, I'm hoping that will help me grow in unexpected ways.
