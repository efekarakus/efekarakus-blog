ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm [@efekarakus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efekarakus), a sr. software engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) from Istanbul, Turkey. 

This blog is mainly for myself and contains lessons learned on software engineering and programming methodology that I want to continue remembering.

I joined Amazon in Aug. 2015, after graduating from [UofI](https://cs.illinois.edu/) with a BS and MS in Computer Science. I'm currently working on improving developer and operator productivity on AWS by shortening the feedback loops throughout the software delivery lifecycle. Previously, I worked actively on making building containerized applications on AWS delightful with the [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli). I'm really proud of this little tool and my teammates are wonderful, so please check it out!
