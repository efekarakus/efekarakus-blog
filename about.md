👋 Hi! I'm [@efekarakus](https://twitter.com/efekarakus), a sr. software engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) from Istanbul, Turkey. 

I joined Amazon in Aug. 2015, after graduating from [UofI](https://cs.illinois.edu/) with a BS and MS in Computer Science. I'm currently working on making building containerized applications on AWS delightful with the [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli). I'm really proud of this little tool that my team built, so please check it out!

I enjoy thinking, learning, and teaching about programming methodology and the human-side of software engineering. [Not just a code 🐒](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E3xfR6IBII).
