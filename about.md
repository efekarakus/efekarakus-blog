👋 Hi! I'm [@efekarakus](https://twitter.com/efekarakus).

A software developer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) from Istanbul, Turkey. 
I recently joined the developer experience team for [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).
My interests seem to shift frequently, but I mostly enjoy thinking and learning about 
software development practices, large scale distributed systems, and data visualization. Not just a code 🐒.
