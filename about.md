👋 Hi! I'm [@efekarakus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efekarakus), a sr. software engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) from Istanbul, Turkey. 

This blog is mainly for myself and contains lessons learned on software engineering and programming methodology that I want to continue remembering.

I joined Amazon in August 2015, after completing both my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from [UofI](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Currently, I'm building the [AWS DevOps Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/what-is.html), where I focus on context engineering to improve the agent's capabilities as well as the engineering and operations required to run the service reliably. Previously, I worked on evaluation and experimentation tools to help product teams [^1] enhance the customer experience for [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/). Before that, I focused on improving the developer experience for containerized applications on AWS with the [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli).

[^1]: A two-pizza team in Amazon parlance -- a small, focused group of engineers, scientists, and product managers with ownership and autonomy over a product.
