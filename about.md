👋 Hi! I'm [@efekarakus](https://twitter.com/efekarakus). A software engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) from Istanbul, Turkey. 

I joined Amazon in August, 2015, after graduating from [UofI](https://cs.illinois.edu/) with a B.S and M.S. in Computer Science. I'm currently working on making using [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) delightful with a new [CLI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli-v2).
I enjoy thinking, learning, and teaching about the mechanics and the human-side of software engineering. Not just a code 🐒.
