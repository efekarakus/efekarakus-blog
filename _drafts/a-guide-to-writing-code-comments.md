title: A Guide to Writing Code Comments
tags: [programming]
---

I recently read [A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhoust](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) and the chapters that stood out the 
most for me were about `/* code comments */`. Although there is a lot of good material out there on how to write
clean code, actionable guides for good in-code documentation is lacking.
Inspired by [A Guide to Naming Variables](https://a-nickels-worth.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-guide-to-naming-variables.html),
this post is my attempt at creating a digest of best-practices for commenting. This document
is a work-in-progress, please send me any constructive feedback on how to improve it.
